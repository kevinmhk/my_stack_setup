# Add Reminder

## Workflow
1. Read the full contents of `scripts/setup.sh` and `README.md` before editing.
2. Locate the current reminder grouping and message style in `scripts/setup.sh`.
3. Add the reminder in the correct group with consistent formatting.
4. Update `README.md` (What It Does or Notes) to include the new manual follow-up.
5. Keep reminder text short, explicit, and actionable.

## Notes
- Do not execute commands in reminders; print literal instructions only.
- Prefer grouping by tool or category if similar reminders already exist.
